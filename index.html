Is there still a chance for us?
Cause if there is I would do everything just to be with you. I'm willing to wait; I'm not rushing anything even if I'm not ready to be in a relationship for a reason, but I am willing to take a risk with you for us. I can take responsibility for my words. I'll prove to you that my love for you is not like your past or anything you've ever known; it's greater than anything, beyond compare. With me, you won't be hurt. You won't shed tears. You won't need to beg for our relationship to be fixed just because of a misunderstanding, because I know I would fix it before there would be a fight. Just know that I'm here, willing to wait for you.
